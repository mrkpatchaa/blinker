##**Give your eyes a rest will ya!**

Inspired by the 20 20 20 rule, this is a little reminder to look 20 feet away from your screen every 20 minutes. Keep your eyes healthy, reduce eye strain, prevent headaches and increase productivity.

This is a simple application based on electron that will display a tray icon to help you configure how you want it to work.
